# Comparing Objects and <i>this</i> Keyword
* We want to create an equals() method in our object class â€“ to check all instance variables of the object to see if they have the same values.
* The <i>this</i> keyword allows a method to call another method within its class. In this case, one constructor can call another to reduce the need to repeat any code. 
* <i>this</i> is a  reference to the current object - the object whose method or constructor is being called.
